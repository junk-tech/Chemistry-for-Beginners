##Self Writing

The Vita An tonii of Athanasiu s presents the w ritten notation o f actions and th oughts as an indispensable element
of the ascetic life. “Let this observation be a safeguard against sinning: let us each note and write down our actions and
impulses of the soul as though we were to report them to each other; and you may rest assured that from utter shame of
becoming known we shall stop sinning and entertaining sinful thoughts altogether. Wh o, having sinned, would no t choose
to lie, hoping to escape detection? Just as we would not give ourselves to lust within sight of each other, so if we were
to write down our thoughts as if telling them to each other, we shall so much the more guard ourselves against foul
thoughts for shame of being known. Now, then, let the written account stand for the eyes of our fellow ascetics, so that
blushing at writing the same as if we were ac tually seen, we may never ponder evil. Molding ourselves in this way, we
shall be able to bring our body into subjection, to please the Lord and to trample under foot the machinations of the
Enemy.” Here, writing about oneself appears clearly in its relationship of complementarity with reclusion: it palliates
the dangers of solitude; it offers what one has done or thought to a possible gaze; the fact of obliging o neself to write
plays the role of a companio n by giving rise to the fear of disapprova l and to shame. Henc e, a first analogy can be put
forward: what others a re to the ascetic in a community, the notebook is to the recluse. But, at the same time, a second
analogy is posed, one that refers to the practice of askesis as work not just on action s but, more p recisely, on tho ught:
the constraint that the presence of others exerts in the domain of conduct, writing will exert in the domain of the inner
impulses of the soul. In this sen se, it has a role very close to that of confession to the director, about which John Cassian
will say, in keeping with Evagrian spirituality, that it must reveal, without exception, all the impulses of the soul (omnes
cogitation es). Finally, writing about inner impulses appea rs, also according to Athanasius’s text, as a weapon in spiritual
comba t. While the Devil is a power who deceives and cause s one to be deluded about on eself (fully half of the V ita
Antonii is devoted to these ruses), writing constitutes a test and a kind of touchstone: by bringing to light the impulses
of thought, it dispe ls the darkness where the en emy’s plots are hatched. T his text—o ne of the oldest that Christian
literature has left us on the subject of spiritual writing—is far from exhausting all the meaning s and forms the latter will
take on later. But one can focus on several of its features that enable one to analyze retrospectively the role of writing
in the philosophical cultivation of the self just before Christianity: its close link with comp anionship, its ap plication to
the impulses of thought, its role as a truth test. These diverse elements are found already in Seneca, Plutarch, Marcus
Aurelius, but with very different values and following altogether d ifferent procedures.
